Hello, this is a Minecraft plugin that integrates Discord servers into your Minecraft servers.

# Regarding code quality and optimizations
2023 for me is YKS (Uni entrance exam) year, so I don't have proper mental for cleaning and optimizing codes. Because of this, my code quality should be trash xd
But you should not have a hard time reading lines.
I'm not giving support for this plugin. I do not have enough time for this.
But if you want to read/modify it but can't read it or too messy, or if you want to commission me after June 2023, you can contact me.
